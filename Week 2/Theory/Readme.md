# 🚀 BabySoC – Learning SoC Design with RVMYTH, PLL, and DAC

## 📝 Problem Statement  
This project focuses on building a compact, educational **System on Chip (SoC)** based on **RVMYTH**, a simple RISC-V processor core.  
To make it more realistic, BabySoC integrates:  

- **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** → For generating stable, high-frequency clocks.  
- **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** → To bridge the digital and analog worlds.  

By converting digital signals into analog form, the DAC enables BabySoC to interact with external devices like **monitors, televisions, and mobile systems**, where the outputs could represent **audio or video signals**.  

The design is implemented on **Sky130 technology** and aims to serve as an **open-source, beginner-friendly platform** for students, hobbyists, and engineers exploring **digital–analog integration in chip design**.

## 🔎 1. What is a System on Chip (SoC)?  
A **System on Chip (SoC)** is essentially a **complete computer built on a single chip**.  
Instead of having separate chips for the processor, memory, and peripherals, an SoC brings them all together into a **compact unit**.  

This makes SoCs ideal for modern devices where **performance, power efficiency, and space** are all critical.  
From smartphones to smartwatches and IoT devices, SoCs are the reason our technology is both **powerful and portable**.

## 🧩 2. Key Components of an SoC  

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** → The “brain” of the chip; executes instructions, calculations, and controls overall operation.  
- **Memory** →  
  - RAM stores temporary data while programs run.  
  - ROM/Flash provides long-term storage for boot code and essential data.  
- **I/O Interfaces** → Connects the SoC to the outside world (USB, camera, sensors, audio jacks).  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** → Handles image and video rendering for displays and games.  
- **DSP (Digital Signal Processor)** → Specialized for tasks like audio processing, filters, and signal enhancement.  
- **Power Management** → Ensures energy efficiency and extends battery life.  
- **Additional Blocks** → Wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), Security modules, Analog/Mixed-signal interfaces like DACs and ADCs.
