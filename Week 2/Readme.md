# 🚀 Week 2 — BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling  

Welcome to **Week 2 Research**!  
This week, we zoom into the **fundamentals of BabySoC design** and explore how **functional modelling** helps us translate theory into working prototypes.  

Think of BabySoC as the “miniature DNA of a chip” — small, simple, yet powerful enough to demonstrate how **processors, memory, and interconnects** interact.  
Here, we’re not just studying block diagrams — we’re building intuition on **how ideas turn into models** and eventually real hardware. 🌟

## 📘 About Week 2  

This module is designed to give you a strong **conceptual foundation** of SoC architecture while teaching you how to **model functionality** step by step.  

You’ll explore:  
- 🔹 **BabySoC architecture basics** (building blocks, data/control flow)  
- 🔹 Abstraction levels in SoC design  
- 🔹 Translating **theory → functional models**  
- 🔹 Applications of functional modelling in **verification and early design exploration**

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  

Before diving in, make sure you’re comfortable with:  
- ✅ Basics of digital logic (mux, flip-flops, datapath control)  
- ✅ Introductory SoC concepts (CPU, memory, I/O)  
- ✅ Installed tools (recommended):  
  - Verilog simulator (Icarus Verilog / Verilator)  
  - Python/Matlab (for high-level modelling)  
  - GTKWave (for visualization)  

💡 *Tip: If Week 1 was about “knowing the language” (RTL), Week 2 is about “thinking in systems.”*

## 📂 Research & Lab Roadmap  

This week is structured in two major parts:  

📅 Part	📝 Focus Area	🔗 Link  
1️⃣	**Theory (Conceptual Understanding)** → BabySoC fundamentals, SoC abstraction levels, mapping specifications to models	`Part1-Theory`  
2️⃣	**Hands-on Functional Modelling** → Building a BabySoC functional model, exploring interactions, running basic experiments	`Part2-FunctionalModelling`  

🔎 Each part includes:  
✔️ Concept notes with clear diagrams  
✔️ Hands-on modelling exercises  
✔️ Step-by-step workflows for BabySoC  
✔️ Reflections connecting **Week 1 RTL basics → Week 2 system-level thinking**  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes  

By the end of Week 2, you will:  
- 🧠 Understand **BabySoC architecture** and its functional layers  
- 🛠️ Model the **behavior of a simplified SoC**  
- 🔄 Bridge the gap between **conceptual theory & implementation**  
- 🚀 Prepare for Week 3, where we move into **deeper RTL integration**
