## ⚙️ BabySoC Design Modules

The **VSDBabySoC** is built by integrating three open-source IPs into one compact SoC:  
1. A **RISC-V Core (RVMYTH)**  
2. A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**  
3. A **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**  

Each of these modules plays a crucial role in achieving a fully functional **digital-to-analog educational SoC**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment  

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 (Linux recommended)  
- **Dependencies:**  
  - `make`  
  - `python3`, `pip3`  
  - `git`  
  - `iverilog` (for RTL simulation)  
  - `gtkwave` (for waveform visualization)  
  - `docker` (for reproducible environments)  

## Step by step all simulation process and its outputs 

In this section we will walk through the whole process of modeling the VSDBabySoC in details.

  #### 1. First we need to install some important packages:

  ```
   sudo apt install make python python3 python3-pip git iverilog gtkwave docker.io
   sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
   cd ~
   pip3 install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
  ```

  #### 2. Now we can clone this repository in an directory:
Clone or set up the directory structure as follows:
  ```
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git
  ```
```
VSDBabySoC/
├── src/
│   ├── include/
│   │   ├── sandpiper.vh
│   │   └── other header files...
│   ├── module/
│   │   ├── vsdbabysoc.v      # Top-level module integrating all components
│   │   ├── rvmyth.v          # RISC-V core module
│   │   ├── avsdpll.v         # PLL module
│   │   ├── avsddac.v         # DAC module
│   │   └── testbench.v       # Testbench for simulation
└── output/
└── compiled_tlv/         # Holds compiled intermediate files if needed
```
#### 3. Verify Tool Installation

   ```
   iverilog -v
   gtkwave --version
   ```
#### 4. Pre-Synthesis Simulation
It's time to make the `pre_synth_sim.vcd`:
 ```
  cd VSDBabySoC
  make pre_synth_sim
or
iverilog -o output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM \
    -I src/include -I src/module \
    src/module/testbench.v src/module/vsdbabysoc.v
cd output/pre_synth_sim
./pre_synth_sim.out
  ```
  The result of the simulation (i.e. `pre_synth_sim.vcd`) will be stored in the `output/pre_synth_sim` directory.
We can see the waveforms by following command:

  ```
  $ gtkwave output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.vcd
  ```
  
#### 🔎 Simulation Results

During the simulation, two of the most important signals to observe are **`CLK`** and **`OUT`**.  
- The **`CLK`** signal is generated by the **PLL** and serves as the input clock for the RVMYTH core.  
- The **`OUT`** signal is produced by the **DAC**, representing the analog output of the SoC.  

Here is the final waveform result of the modeling process:

![pre_synth_sim](Images/presynth.png)

#### 🧩 Observation from Pre-Synthesis Simulation

The above waveform illustrates the **pre-synthesis simulation** of the `VSDBabySoC` design.  
This simulation is performed before synthesis to verify the logical correctness of the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design.  
It ensures that the Verilog modules for the processor, PLL, and DAC interact correctly before being converted into a gate-level netlist.

---

#### 🔍 Signal Analysis

- **CLK:**  
  Represents the input clock signal driving the system.  
  The waveform shows a uniform and continuous clock pulse, confirming proper clock generation and propagation to all submodules.

- **reset:**  
  Used to initialize the entire SoC into a known state.  
  At the beginning of the simulation, it is asserted high to clear all registers and memory locations. Once de-asserted, normal operation begins.

- **RV_TO_DAC[9:0]:**  
  This 10-bit bus transmits data from the `RVMYTH` processor to the `DAC` module.  
  The changing values in hexadecimal (e.g., 001, 003, 006, 00A, 00F, 015, 01C, etc.) indicate sequential digital output from the RVMYTH register (`x17`), which is continuously updated each clock cycle.  
  This confirms correct data transfer between the processor and DAC.

- **OUT:**  
  Represents the DAC output signal, which models an analog output using a `real` datatype in RTL simulation.  
  Since this is a pre-synthesis run, the analog behavior can still be observed, reflecting how the digital values from `RV_TO_DAC[9:0]` are converted into analog-like waveform responses.

---

#### 💡 Key Insight

From this pre-synthesis simulation:
- The design’s **functional correctness** at the RTL level is verified.  
- The **RVMYTH processor**, **PLL**, and **DAC** modules communicate properly.  
- The **data flow from digital to analog** is clearly visible through the changing `RV_TO_DAC` and `OUT` signals.  
- The **clock and reset behavior** is stable, ensuring reliable synchronization across the SoC.

---

#### ✅ Conclusion

The pre-synthesis simulation confirms that the RTL description of `VSDBabySoC` behaves as expected.  
All functional blocks — including the **RVMYTH core**, **PLL**, and **DAC** — are correctly interconnected and operational.  
This successful simulation establishes a solid foundation for proceeding to the synthesis stage, where the RTL design will be transformed into a gate-level netlist while preserving this verified functionality.

  $ cd OpenLane/
  $ make openlane
  $ make pdk
  $ make test
  ```

### ⚙️ Synthesis and Post-Synthesis Simulation



The **first step in the design flow** is to synthesize the generated RTL code.  
Once synthesis is complete, we perform **post-synthesis simulation** to verify the correctness of the design.

This step is crucial because it allows us to:  
- Validate that the synthesized netlist behaves the same as the RTL description.  
- Detect any potential mismatches, optimization effects, or bugs introduced during synthesis.  
- Ensure that the design remains functionally consistent before moving to the physical implementation stage.  

Both **pre-synthesis (RTL level)** and **post-synthesis (gate-level)** simulation results should be **identical**.  
If differences appear, it typically indicates either:  
- RTL coding issues (such as uninitialized registers, improper blocking/non-blocking usage), or  
- Constraints not being met during synthesis.  

By confirming identical behavior, we establish confidence that our RTL description is robust and ready for further steps in the SoC design flow.

To run a post-synthesis simulation, use:
```tcl
iverilog -o output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.out -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM \
    -I src/include -I src/module \
    src/module/testbench.v output/synthesized/vsdbabysoc.synth.v
cd output/post_synth_sim
./post_synth_sim.out
```
User could bypass these confusing steps by using our provided Makefile:

  ```
   cd ~/VSDBabySoC
   make post_synth_sim
  ```
The result of the simulation (i.e. `post_synth_sim.vcd`) will be stored in the `output/post_synth_sim` directory and the waveform could be seen by the following command:

  ```
   gtkwave output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.vcd
  ```
Here is the final result:

  ![post_synth_sim](Images/postsynth.png)
  
---

#### 🧩 Observation from Post-Synthesis Simulation

The above waveform represents the **post-synthesis simulation** of the `VSDBabySoC` design, where the synthesized netlist was simulated to verify its behavior.  
The simulation confirms that the synthesized design maintains the same logical behavior as the RTL model, validating the correctness of the synthesis process.

---

#### 🔍 Signal Analysis

- **CLK:**  
  The clock signal generated by the PLL, providing a stable and high-frequency reference to synchronize all modules.  
  The waveform shows a consistent, periodic clock pattern, indicating that the PLL is functioning correctly.

- **reset:**  
  The reset signal initializes the RVMYTH processor.  
  Initially asserted, it ensures all registers and components are set to a known state before normal operation begins.

- **\core.CLK:**  
  This is the clock input of the `RVMYTH` core, derived directly from the PLL output.  
  Its continuous toggling throughout the simulation confirms correct clock distribution within the SoC.

- **OUT (SoC Level):**  
  Represents the DAC’s analog output at the SoC level.  
  In the post-synthesis simulation, it behaves as a digital signal because synthesis tools do not support analog (`real`) datatypes.  
  The waveform transitions indicate that the DAC is correctly receiving digital data from the processor.

- **\core.OUT[9:0]:**  
  This 10-bit bus carries digital data from the RVMYTH core’s register (specifically register `x17`) to the DAC.  
  The hexadecimal values (e.g., 000, 011, 080, 0A8, 0E7, etc.) represent sequential digital outputs, showing how the processor continuously updates data for digital-to-analog conversion.

---

#### 💡 Key Insight

The simulation waveform verifies:
- Proper **clock synchronization** across the entire SoC via the PLL.  
- Successful **data transfer** between the RVMYTH core and the DAC.  
- Correct **digital-to-analog conversion pipeline**, even though the final analog behavior is approximated in digital form due to synthesis constraints.

---

#### ✅ Conclusion

The post-synthesis simulation results confirm the successful integration of all three modules — **RVMYTH**, **PLL**, and **DAC** — within the `VSDBabySoC`.  
The output waveforms demonstrate stable operation, correct timing, and accurate data flow, indicating that the design is ready for further verification and physical implementation stages.

---

### ⚠️ Key Limitation
A critical observation is that **post-synthesis simulations cannot directly handle `real` datatype signals**.  
- Therefore, the `OUT` port at the SoC level is modeled as a digital `wire`.  
- This means that while the DAC’s internal `OUT` shows analog behavior, the top-level SoC output is restricted to a digital approximation.

## 🌟 Conclusion — End of Week 2

Week 2 marked a significant step forward in understanding the **synthesis and simulation flow** of a real SoC design.  
Through the BabySoC experiment, I explored how RTL design translates into a gate-level representation while maintaining identical functionality between **pre-synthesis** and **post-synthesis** simulations.  

Observing clean and stable waveforms reaffirmed that the design was logically and structurally sound — a crucial validation before moving toward **physical design** and **timing analysis**.  

With this milestone, Week 2 concludes with a sense of accomplishment and curiosity — a reminder that every synthesized signal and simulated waveform brings us one step closer to bridging **digital logic** with **real silicon**.
