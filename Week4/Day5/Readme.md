# **1. Static Behavior Evaluation: CMOS Inverter Robustness – Power Supply Variation**

### Overview
The behavior of a CMOS inverter is strongly influenced by its **power supply voltage (VDD)**. Changing VDD doesn’t just alter the output voltage swing; it also affects the **switching threshold, noise margins, and overall circuit reliability**. Understanding these effects is crucial for designing robust digital circuits under varying operating conditions.

---

### SPICE Simulation Approach
To study this, we ran SPICE simulations of the CMOS inverter while **varying the supply voltage**. Key points of analysis included:  

- Observing how the **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** shifts with different VDD levels.  
- Tracking changes in the **switching threshold (VM)**.  
- Calculating **low and high-level noise margins** to evaluate the inverter’s resilience.  

This approach helps visualize how supply scaling impacts both **logic integrity** and **performance**.

---

### Key Observations
1. **Decreasing VDD:**  
   - The switching threshold (**VM**) moves closer to the mid-supply point.  
   - Noise margins shrink, making the inverter **more sensitive to input fluctuations**.  

2. **Impact on Reliability:**  
   - Lower supply voltages reduce **noise immunity**, which can cause logic errors in cascaded stages.  

3. **Increasing VDD:**  
   - The inverter benefits from **larger noise margins**, improving robustness.  
   - However, higher VDD also increases **static power consumption**, highlighting a trade-off between reliability and energy efficiency.  

> By analyzing VTC shifts under different VDD values, we gain insight into **power-performance trade-offs** in CMOS logic, which is critical for low-power and high-reliability designs.

### **Simulation Observations: Power Supply Variations**

1. **Robust Operation at Lower VDD:**  
   - The CMOS inverter operates effectively even at 0.8V, which is below half the original supply voltage (1.8V) and close to the transistor threshold voltages.

2. **Switching Threshold Proportionality:**  
   - With a fixed transistor ratio (*r*), the switching threshold (VM) is approximately proportional to VDD.

3. **Gain in Transition Region:**  
   - The inverter gain in the transition region increases as the supply voltage decreases.

4. **Transition Region Width:**  
   - The width of the transition region reduces when the supply voltage is scaled down from the original VDD.

### **Limitations of Operating at Low Supply Voltages**

1. **Performance Degradation:**  
   - Lowering the supply voltage reduces energy dissipation but significantly increases gate transition times, negatively affecting performance.

2. **Parameter Sensitivity:**  
   - At low supply voltages, the DC characteristics become highly sensitive to variations in device parameters, such as transistor threshold voltages.

3. **Reduced Signal Swing:**  
   - Scaling VDD reduces signal swing, lowering internal noise (e.g., crosstalk) but increasing sensitivity to external noise sources, which do not scale proportionally.

### **CMOS Inverter Robustness to Device Variations**

1. **Design vs. Real Operating Conditions:**  
   - Gates are designed for nominal conditions, but actual operating temperatures and device parameters can vary widely after fabrication.

2. **DC Characteristics Stability:**  
   - The DC characteristics of the CMOS inverter are relatively insensitive to variations in device parameters, allowing the gate to remain functional across a broad range of operating conditions.

3. **Sources of Variation:**  
   - One common source of variation is the etching process during fabrication, which can affect device parameters.

### **CMOS Inverter Robustness: Extreme Device Width Variation**

- **Robustness to Width Variation:**  
   The CMOS inverter remains functional even under extreme variations in device width (W) due to its static behavior properties.  

- **Effect on Switching Threshold:**  
   Large deviations in device width primarily affect the switching threshold \( V_M \) but do not drastically impact the inverter's ability to operate as a logic gate.  

- **Impact on Noise Margins:**  
   Variations in width cause asymmetry in the noise margins, with one margin (high or low) reducing while the other increases.

- **Key Insight:**  
   The CMOS inverter exhibits robust static behavior, tolerating extreme width variations without functional failure.
