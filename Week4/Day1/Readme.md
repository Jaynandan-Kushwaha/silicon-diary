# ‚ö° Day 1 ‚Äî NMOS Drain Current (Id) vs Drain-to-Source Voltage (Vds)

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **NgspiceSky130 learning series**!  
This day begins your journey into **transistor-level design and SPICE simulation** using the open-source **Sky130 PDK**.  
We‚Äôll explore the electrical behavior of the **NMOS transistor** and understand how **drain current (Id)** varies with **drain-to-source voltage (Vds)** under different gate bias conditions.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

- Understand why SPICE simulations are essential in circuit design.  
- Explore NMOS transistor fundamentals and body effect.  
- Analyze **linear (resistive)** and **saturation** regions of NMOS operation.

## üß© 1. Introduction to Circuit Design and SPICE Simulations  

SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a powerful tool for **predicting circuit performance** before fabrication.  
It allows us to simulate device behavior, verify electrical parameters, and visualize circuit responses to different inputs.

Key Topics:
- Purpose and advantages of SPICE simulations  
- Basics of NMOS structure and operation  
- Threshold voltage and strong inversion  
- Substrate (body) bias and threshold variation  

---

### üìò Why SPICE?

In circuit design, SPICE provides a **virtual lab environment** that replicates real-world device behavior.  
For instance, consider a CMOS **inverter**:

- The **PMOS** (pull-up) and **NMOS** (pull-down) share a common output node.  
- Their **gates** receive the same input, ensuring complementary operation.  
- The **output** switches between **VDD** and **GND**, producing logical inversion.

SPICE allows designers to confirm correct switching behavior, analyze **propagation delays**, and study **power consumption** before committing to silicon fabrication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. NMOS Device Fundamentals  

### üß† Understanding the NMOS Transistor

An **NMOS transistor** conducts when a **positive gate voltage (Vgs)** exceeds the **threshold voltage (Vt)**.  
This voltage induces a conductive channel between **drain** and **source**, allowing current flow.

![NMOS Structure](https://github.com/Jaynandan-Kushwaha/silicon-diary/blob/main/Week4/Day1/Images/Screenshot%202025-10-13%20235455.png)

**Key Parameters:**
- **Vt (Threshold Voltage):** Minimum gate voltage required to form an inversion channel.  
- **Strong Inversion:** Region where the induced channel is fully formed and current flow maximizes.  
- **Body Effect:** Variation of threshold voltage due to substrate potential (Vsb).  

---

### ‚ö° Threshold Voltage and Body Effect

The threshold voltage is not constant ‚Äî it changes with substrate bias (Vsb).  
SPICE models use parameters such as **body-effect coefficient (Œ≥)** and **Fermi potential (Œ¶F)** to calculate this variation.

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Vt0 | Threshold voltage when Vsb = 0 |
| Œ≥ (Gamma) | Body effect coefficient |
| Œ¶F | Fermi potential (process-dependent) |

These are foundry-defined parameters embedded in the **Sky130 model files** to ensure simulation accuracy.

## üìä 3. NMOS Operation Regions  

The NMOS transistor operates in two major regions based on **Vds** and **Vgs**:

---

### üîπ (a) Resistive / Linear Region

Occurs when **Vds < (Vgs - Vt)**.  
Here, the channel is continuous, and the transistor behaves like a **voltage-controlled resistor**.

![Linear Region](https://github.com/Jaynandan-Kushwaha/silicon-diary/blob/main/Week4/Day1/Images/Screenshot%202025-10-15%20004825.png)

**Current Equation:**
\[
I_d = Œº_n C_{ox} \frac{W}{L} [(V_{gs} - V_t)V_{ds} - \frac{V_{ds}^2}{2}]
\]

Where:
- **Œºn:** Electron mobility  
- **Cox:** Oxide capacitance per unit area  
- **W/L:** Width-to-length ratio of the MOSFET  

![Drift-Diffusion Model](https://github.com/Jaynandan-Kushwaha/silicon-diary/blob/main/Week4/Day1/Images/Screenshot%202025-10-15%20230408.png)

The **drain current (Id)** increases linearly with **Vds**, forming the initial slope in the Id‚ÄìVds plot.

---

**SPICE Observation (Resistive Mode):**  
In simulation, for each **Vgs** value, **Vds** is swept, and Id is plotted.  
As **Vds** approaches **Vgs - Vt**, the linear behavior transitions into saturation.

---

### üîπ (b) Saturation / Pinch-off Region

Occurs when **Vds ‚â• (Vgs - Vt)**.  
The channel pinches off near the drain, and current becomes almost constant.

![Saturation Concept](https://github.com/Jaynandan-Kushwaha/silicon-diary/blob/main/Week4/Day1/Images/Screenshot%202025-10-16%20002723.png)

**Current Equation:**
\[
I_d = \frac{1}{2} Œº_n C_{ox} \frac{W}{L} (V_{gs} - V_t)^2
\]

Here, **Id** is primarily controlled by **Vgs**, making this region essential for analog amplifiers and current sources.

![Saturation Graphs](https://github.com/Jaynandan-Kushwaha/silicon-diary/blob/main/Week4/Day1/Images/Screenshot%202025-10-16%20004407.png)

**SPICE Observation (Saturation Mode):**
- Id saturates with increasing Vds.  
- The saturation level rises with higher Vgs values.  
- The transition point (**Vds = Vgs - Vt**) is clearly visible in the simulated plots.
