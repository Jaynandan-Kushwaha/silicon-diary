## 🌟 About This Repo  

Welcome to my **Silicon Diary** 📖 — a repository where I record my **daily progress** in the  
**VSD Hardware Design Program (HDP)**.  

This repo is not just a collection of notes — it’s a **story of learning**:  
from writing **C models → RTL design → SoC integration → Physical Design (RTL2GDS)** → to a **tape-out ready chip** 🖥️⚡.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  

✔️ **Daily Folders** – (`Day0`, `Day1`, …) → Each contains tasks, explanations & results.  
✔️ **README.md** – Inside every Day folder with detailed notes & learnings.  
✔️ **Images/** – Screenshots, diagrams, logs for visual clarity.  
✔️ **Skills in Action** – Linux, Verilog, SoC Design, RTL2GDS Flow, Open-Source Tools.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  

- **Languages**: `C`, `Verilog`  
- **EDA Tools**: `Yosys`, `Icarus Verilog`, `GTKWave`, `NGSpice`, `Magic VLSI`, `OpenLane`  
- **Platforms**: `Ubuntu/Linux`, `GitHub`  
- **Workflows**: `RTL Design → Synthesis → SoC Integration → Physical Design (RTL2GDS)`  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- 🧠 Master the **end-to-end VLSI design flow** (RTL → GDSII).  
- 🛠️ Gain **hands-on experience** with open-source chip design tools.  
- 🔬 Strengthen my fundamentals in **chip design & verification**.  
- 📝 Build a **clean, professional, and reviewer-friendly repo** to track progress.
