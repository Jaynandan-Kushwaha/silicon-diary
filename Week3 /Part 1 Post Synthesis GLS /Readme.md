# ‚öôÔ∏è Part 1 ‚Äî Post Synthesis GLS: ‚ÄúBringing BabySoC to Life‚Äù

Welcome to **Part 1 of Week 3!** üöÄ  
Up to now, your BabySoC has lived in the world of RTL ‚Äî abstract, fast, and ideal.  
But in the real silicon world, wires have delays, gates have timing, and logic must keep up with the clock.  

This is where **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** steps in ‚Äî it‚Äôs like giving your design its first **heartbeat** after synthesis.  
We move from ideal logic to the actual gate-level representation, ensuring that every flip-flop and signal transition behaves correctly when timing becomes real. üí°

## üß† What Is GLS?

**Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** is the stage where your synthesized design is tested in its true hardware form.  
After synthesis, your design turns into a **netlist** ‚Äî a file describing how real logic gates are connected.  
GLS takes this netlist and runs simulations to verify that functionality is preserved **and** that timing behaves as expected.

Unlike RTL simulation:
- GLS includes **propagation delays** from real hardware.
- The testbench remains the same, but the underlying logic now mirrors **post-synthesis reality**.
- It helps detect issues that may not appear at the RTL level.

---

## üîç Why BabySoC Needs GLS

Your **BabySoC** integrates multiple modules ‚Äî the RISC-V core, PLL, DAC, and more.  
Each has its own timing behavior and clock domain. GLS ensures that when these modules talk to each other, they **stay synchronized** and **stable** under real timing constraints.  

Here‚Äôs what GLS validates:
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timing Consistency:** Signals meet setup and hold times defined in the Standard Delay Format (SDF).  
- ‚ö° **Functional Integrity:** The synthesized design still performs the intended operations.  
- üß© **Inter-Module Interaction:** No unexpected glitches or metastability during communication between components.

---

## üß∞ Tools You‚Äôll Use

To bring your BabySoC to life at the gate level, you‚Äôll work with:

- üß† **Icarus Verilog** ‚Äî for compiling and simulating the gate-level netlist.  
- üåà **GTKWave** ‚Äî for waveform visualization and debugging timing delays.  
- üìÑ **SDF Files** ‚Äî to inject real-world delay data into your simulations.  

These tools together allow you to view how your design transitions from **‚Äúlogical correctness‚Äù** to **‚Äúhardware readiness.‚Äù**

---

## üß≠ The Real Purpose

Think of GLS as the **truth test** for synthesis.  
It answers one simple but critical question:

> ‚ÄúDoes my design still behave correctly when it becomes hardware?‚Äù

When you see your BabySoC waveforms align perfectly under timing delays ‚Äî that‚Äôs your moment of validation. ‚ú®

## üí¨ In a Nutshell

> ‚ÄúGate-Level Simulation is where your SoC stops being an idea and starts acting like a chip ‚Äî  
> precise, timed, and ready for silicon.‚Äù ‚öôÔ∏è

Here is the step-by-step execution plan for running the  commands manually:
---
### **Step 1: Load the Top-Level Design and Supporting Modules**
```bash
yosys
```
