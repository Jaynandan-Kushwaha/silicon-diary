# 🚀 RTL Design & Synthesis Workshop — *Sky130 Edition*  

> Dive into the fascinating world of **digital logic design** where every line of Verilog can shape the blueprint of silicon.  
This workshop is not just about coding flip-flops and gates — it’s about **thinking like a chip designer**, simulating your ideas, optimizing them, and finally synthesizing them into something closer to real hardware.  
If you’ve ever wondered how RTL transforms into circuits, or how synthesis tools squeeze out efficiency, you’re in the right place! 🌟

## 📘 About the Workshop  

This workshop is crafted for **students, hobbyists, and engineers** who want to strengthen their understanding of digital design and RTL flow. You’ll learn to:  

- 🖊️ Write **clean Verilog RTL code**  
- 🧪 Run simulations with **Icarus Verilog + GTKWave**  
- ⚙️ Perform **logic synthesis** with **Yosys + Sky130 PDK**  
- 🧩 Master essential design concepts:  
  - Testbenches  
  - Timing libraries  
  - Flip-flop coding styles  
  - Combinational vs sequential optimization  

By the end, you won’t just know RTL — you’ll know how to make it **efficient, optimized, and hardware-ready**.
