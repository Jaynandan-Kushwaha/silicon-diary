# Day 5 â€“ Optimization in Synthesis

**Author:** Jaynandan Kushwaha

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Day 5 focuses on the **optimization phase of synthesis**, where we refine coding techniques to achieve efficient hardware implementation. The day emphasizes how conditional constructs like **if** and **case** statements impact synthesized logic and how incomplete specifications can lead to unintended hardware such as latches.

We then move into the subtleties of **overlapping case constructs**, examining how synthesis tools interpret them and how to avoid mismatches between simulation and implementation. Finally, we explore the use of **for loops and generate statements**, powerful constructs that enhance code reusability and scalability, while also observing how synthesis tools optimize them.

This day is all about writing RTL that is not only functionally correct but also **optimized for synthesis, area, timing, and power**.
