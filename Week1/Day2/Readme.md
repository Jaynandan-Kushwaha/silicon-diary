# Day 2 – Timing Libraries, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis, and Efficient Flop Coding Styles
Author: Jaynandan Kushwaha  
 ---- 

## 📌Introduction
Day 2 takes us deeper into the practical aspects of synthesis and optimization.  
We begin by understanding **timing libraries** and how they shape the translation of RTL into gate-level designs.  
Next, we explore the differences between **hierarchical and flat synthesis**, examining how design structure impacts performance and optimization.  
Finally, we dive into **flop coding styles** and learn how subtle changes in coding can lead to big differences in **timing, power, and area efficiency**.  

This day is all about gaining insights into the “behind-the-scenes” mechanisms that guide synthesis tools and learning how to write RTL that works *with* the tools, not against them.
