# Day 1 – Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis  

Author: **Jaynandan Kushwaha**

## 📌 Introduction  

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop** using **Sky130 PDKs**.  

This session marks the starting point of our digital design journey, where we move from **abstract hardware descriptions** to **practical, synthesizable logic**.  

You will be introduced to:  
- Writing Verilog RTL code and testbenches.  
- Running simulations using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**.  
- Visualizing outputs with **GTKWave**.  
- Understanding the basics of **logic synthesis with Yosys**.  
- Mapping RTL to the **Sky130 standard cell libraries**.  

The aim of this day is to build a **strong foundation**. Just as an architect first draws blueprints before construction, we will learn how to **design, simulate, and synthesize** digital logic that can ultimately be realized on silicon.  

By the end of Day 1, you will not only understand the RTL design flow but also **perform your first hands-on simulation and synthesis**. This will set the stage for deeper explorations in the upcoming sessions.

### 1. Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
In introduction it started with some basic definations which are describe below and its important to know about these terminology before starting it 
#### Simulator
Simulators are essential tools used to model, analyze, and verify the behavior of integrated circuits before physical fabrication, ensuring design accuracy and performance.
